summary: Streaming ZIP archiver for NGINX
description: |
  mod_zip assembles ZIP archives dynamically. It can stream component
  files from upstream servers with nginx's native proxying code, so
  that the process never takes up more than a few KB of RAM at a time,
  even while assembling archives that are (potentially) gigabytes in
  size.

  mod_zip supports a number of "modern" ZIP features, including large
  files, UTC timestamps, and UTF-8 filenames. It allows clients to
  resume large downloads using the "Range" and "If-Range" headers,
  although these feature require the server to know the file checksums
  (CRC-32's) in advance. See "Usage" for details.

  To unzip files on the fly, check out nginx-module-unzip.

summary: Zero-latency IP blocking using Linux kernel ipsets
description: |
  High-performance NGINX module for IP-based access control using Linux kernel ipsets.
  
  Key Features:
  
  - Blacklist/Whitelist modes: Block or allow IPs based on ipset membership
  - Honeypot auto-add: Automatically add malicious IPs to ipsets with configurable timeouts and custom HTTP status codes
  - Built-in rate limiting: Per-IP rate limiting with auto-ban to ipsets
  - JavaScript challenges: Proof-of-work challenges to filter bots
  - Dual-stack support: Works with both IPv4 and IPv6 ipsets
  - FirewallD compatible: Integrates with firewall-cmd managed ipsets
  - Whitelist bypass: Whitelisted IPs skip rate limiting and challenges
  - Dry-run mode: Test rules in production without blocking
  - Prometheus metrics: Native /metrics endpoint for monitoring
  - LRU cache: Shared memory cache for high-performance lookups
  
  Uses libipset directly (no CLI fallback) for kernel-level performance.
  Compatible with realip module for proper client IP detection behind proxies.

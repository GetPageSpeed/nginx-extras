summary: Shibboleth auth request module for NGINX
description: |
  This module allows Nginx to work with Shibboleth, by way of Shibboleth's
  FastCGI authorizer. This module requires specific configuration in order to
  work correctly, as well as Shibboleth's FastCGI authorizer application 
  available on the system.

  It aims to be similar to parts of Apache's mod_shib, though Shibboleth
  authorisation and authentication settings are configured via shibboleth2.xml
  rather than in the web server configuration.

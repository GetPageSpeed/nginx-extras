summary: NGINX HTTP rDNS module
description: |
  This module allows to make a reverse DNS (rDNS) lookup
  for incoming connection and provides simple access control
  of incoming hostname by allow/deny rules (similar to
  HttpAccessModule allow/deny directives; regular expressions
  are supported).

  Module works with the DNS server defined by the standard
  resolver directive. This module uses nginx core resolver
  cache when resolving DNS lookup, for a maximum of 30
  seconds or DNS response TTL.

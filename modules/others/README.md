# Other NGINX modules

This directory contains definitions of modules which are packaged outside of this system.

The module definitions help to reference a reason why they need to be built in a separate system,
and also a source of a documentation for generating complete module list available in nginx-extras
collection.

See `comment` field for reasoning of not including to the main list.

summary: NGINX cookie flag module
description: |
  This module for NGINX allows to set the flags "HttpOnly", "secure"
  and "SameSite" for cookies in the "Set-Cookie" upstream response
  headers.

  The register of letters for the flags doesn't matter as it will be
  converted to the correct value. The order of cookie declaration
  among multiple directives doesn't matter too. It is possible to set
  a default value using symbol "*". In this case flags will be added
  to the all cookies if no other value for them is overriden.

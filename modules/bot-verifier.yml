summary: A search index bot verification module for NGINX
description: |
  [BETA] This module has been tested on a handful of production
  websites.

  This is an NGINX module designed to validate actors claiming to be
  search engine indexers. It is right to disable security mechanisms
  for valid search engine bots to ensure your controls do not interfere
  with page rankings on any of the search providers. The issue is
  that the User Agent header cannot be trusted. In order to ensure you
  are allowing only valid search engine indexers, you must validate
  according to their published standards.

  This module performs that validation and caches the results to ensure
  you do not pay validation penalties on every request.

summary: Time-based one-time password (TOTP) authentication for NGINX
description: |
  The Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm, provides a secure mechanism 
  for short-lived one-time password values, which are desirable for enhanced security. 
  This algorithm can be used across a wide range of network applications ranging 
  from remote Virtual Private Network (VPN) access, Wi-Fi network logon to 
  transaction-orientated Web applications.

  This module provides TOTP authentication for a NGINX server.

summary: NGINX module for syncing upstreams from consul or etcd
description: |
  Syncs upstreams from consul or others, dynamically modify backend-servers
  attribute(weight, max_fails,...), needn't reload nginx.

  It may not always be convenient to modify configuration files and restart
  NGINX. For example, if you are experiencing large amounts of traffic and high
  load, restarting NGINX and reloading the configuration at that point further
  increases load on the system and can temporarily degrade performance.

  The module can be more smoothly expansion and constriction, and will not
  influence the performance.

  Another module, nginx-module-stream-upsync supports nginx stream
  module(TCP protocol), please be noticed.

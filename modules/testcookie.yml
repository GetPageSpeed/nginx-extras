summary: NGINX testcookie robot mitigation module
description: |
  Simple robot mitigation module using cookie based challenge/response
  technique. Not supported any more.

  Challenge cookies can be set using different methods:

  * "Set-Cookie" + 302/307 HTTP Location redirect
  * "Set-Cookie" + HTML meta refresh redirect
  * Custom template, JavaScript can be used here.

  To prevent automatic parsing, challenge cookie value can be encrypted
  with AES-128 in CBC mode using custom/random key and iv, and then
  decrypted at client side with JavaScript.

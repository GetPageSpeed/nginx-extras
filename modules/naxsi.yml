summary: NGINX Anti XSS & SQL Injection module
description: |
  NAXSI is an open-source, high performance, low rules
  maintenance WAF for NGINX.

  This module, by default, reads a small subset of simple
  (and readable) rules containing 99% of known patterns involved in
  website vulnerabilities. For example, <, | or drop are not supposed
  to be part of a URI.

  Being very simple, those patterns may match legitimate queries, it
  is the Naxsi's administrator duty to add specific rules that will
  whitelist legitimate behaviours. The administrator can either add
  whitelists manually by analyzing nginx's error log, or (recommended)
  start the project with an intensive auto-learning phase that will
  automatically generate whitelisting rules regarding a website's
  behaviour.

  In short, Naxsi behaves like a DROP-by-default firewall, the only
  task is to add required ACCEPT rules for the target website to work
  properly.

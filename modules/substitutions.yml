summary: String substitutions module for nginx
description: |
  nginx_substitutions_filter is a filter module which can do
  both regular expression and fixed string substitutions on
  response bodies.

  This module is quite different from the Nginx's native
  Substitution Module.

  It scans the output chains buffer and matches string
  line by line, just like Apache's mod_substitute

  commit-based releases not yet supported, and upstream did not tag
  anything in years, so we tag own releases in our fork

summary: Native cross-site scripting support in NGINX
description: |
  This module adds cross-site AJAX support to NGINX. 
  Currently only cross-site GET is supported. 
  But cross-site POST will be added in the future.

  The cross-site GET is currently implemented as JSONP (or "JSON with padding"). 
  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#JSONP for more details.

summary: NGINX Fancy Index module
description: |
  The Fancy Index module makes possible the generation of file
  listings, like the built-in autoindex module does, but adding
  a touch of style.
  This is possible because the module allows a certain degree 
  of customization of the generated content:
  
    * Custom headers, either local or stored remotely.
    * Custom footers, either local or stored remotely.
    * Add your own CSS style rules.
    * Allow choosing to sort elements by name (default), 
      modification time, or size; both ascending (default), 
      or descending.

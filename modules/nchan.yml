summary: Scalable, flexible pub/sub server for the modern web
description: |
  Nchan is a scalable, flexible pub/sub server for the modern web,
  built as a module for the NGINX web server. It can be configured
  as a standalone server, or as a shim between your application
  and hundreds, thousands, or millions of live subscribers.
  It can buffer messages in memory, on-disk, or via Redis.

  Messages are published to channels with HTTP POST requests or
  Websocket, and subscribed also through Websocket, long-polling,
  EventSource (SSE), old-fashioned interval polling, and more.

  In a web browser, you can use Websocket or EventSource natively,
  or the NchanSubscriber.js wrapper library. It supports Long-Polling,
  EventSource, and resumable Websockets, and has a few other added
  convenience options. It's also available on NPM.
